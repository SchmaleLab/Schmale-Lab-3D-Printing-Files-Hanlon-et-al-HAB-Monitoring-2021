These are 3D printing files (.stl) associated with the manuscript by Hanlon et al. to be submitted for publication in 2021. These articles are open access, and are free to use.

This sampler is designed around a 50mL conical tube. A rubber O-ring must be added on the bottom of the tube to secure the tube in place. We used tubes from Genesee Scientific, Cat #: 28-108 ( https://geneseesci.com/shop-online/product-details/28-108/50ml-conical-centrifuge-tubes-polypropylene ).
